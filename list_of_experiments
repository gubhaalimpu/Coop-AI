## experiment 1:
5 agents on each politcal party 
policy: 
if two agents acting at the same time misinform, they get a reward of -2 each
if one agent misinforms, while the other is truthful, the former gets +5, while the latter (and all other agents of latter's party') receives a -5 reward
if both agents acting simultaneously are truthful, they get a reward of -1 each. 

### observations:
1. The code was incorrect, the code was assigning an action to each agent and iteratively the agent would act. At the end of an episode \
    the Q-table would be updated where an agent independently learns how to maximize rewards. The policy of two agents choosing the same \
        action together (rewards of -2 each) is not applied.


## experiment 2:
5 agents on each political party
policy: 
if two agents acting at the same time misinform, they get a reward of -2 each
if one agent misinforms, while the other is truthful, the former gets +5, while the latter (and all other agents of latter's party') receives a -5 reward
if both agents acting simultaneously are truthful, they get a reward of -1 each. 

### observations:
1. The code was corrected, a random yellow agent was picked and partnered with a random green agent, the policy was applied successfully.
2. The plot shows that initially the rewards start slow
3. We then observe that the rewards increase for the party that chooses to misinform while the other party's rewards decrease.
4. The agents then learn that choosing to misinform de-stabilizes and pushes the other party to do the same.
5. The agents of both parties then learn to reduce the number of defections.
6. Both parties learn to defect at the same rate and stabilize. 
6. Running the experiment again showed a non-collaborative approach.
7. One party chose to consistently misinform and saw increased rewards and learned that policy.
8. The other party showed consitent truthful behavior but increased its defection rate to increase their rewards.
9. Number of episodes for the second run if increased might result in the previous observation.
